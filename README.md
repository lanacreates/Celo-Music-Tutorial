# Decentralized Music Streaming Service on Celo

Welcome to the Decentralized Music Streaming Service project! This service allows artists to upload and share their music tracks directly to listeners, facilitated by the Celo blockchain and IPFS. We're striving to redefine the traditional music industry by eliminating intermediaries and allowing artists to earn more from their creativity.

## Project Description

This project consists of a Solidity smart contract for managing music tracks and a React front-end for user interaction. IPFS is used for decentralized file storage. This combination creates a powerful decentralized application that is both user-friendly and highly functional. 

## Languages and Tools Used

- Solidity
- JavaScript
- React.js
- Node.js

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following software installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
- [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd celo-music
```

3. Install NPM packages:
```
npm install
```

4. Compile and migrate the smart contract:
```
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```

5. Run the development server:
```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

To test the application, upload new music tracks via the form on the homepage. The tracks should appear in the list below and should be playable directly in the browser.

## Deployment

Follow the deployment steps outlined in the tutorial.
